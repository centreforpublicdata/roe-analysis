    "In other words, to join the beneficial owners of property in England & Wales that is owned by an overseas company, with the details of the property they own, where possible \n",
    "\n",
    "Joining these two datasets isn't totally straightforward because Companies House hasn't yet asked ROE entities to specify their registered titles, and HMLR doesn't yet include the ROE identifier in its own data, so we need to join fuzzily based on company name.  \n",

    "Nevertheless we can match a reasonable number of titles - though anything matched should be double-checked. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you have the latest versions of the following datasets loaded into Google BigQuery (or contact anna@centreforpublicdata.org if you want to take a copy of our BigQuery datasets):\n",
    "\n",
    "- HM Land Registry [Overseas companies that own property in England and Wales](https://use-land-property-data.service.gov.uk/datasets/ocod).\n",
    "- Companies House [Basic Companies Data](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html)\n",
    "- Companies House [Persons of Significant Control](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_pscdata.html) (PSC)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update the constants below with your own BigQuery project ID and table names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please use any matched data responsibly, and don't republish or map data without removing residential properties.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes for users**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be aware that HMLR records legal title to property, and ROE is about beneficial title. So there is a conceptual difference between the two datasets.\n",
